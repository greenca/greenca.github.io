</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Suppose you have a differential equation that you want to solve numerically. An approach you might take is collocation, which is based on the idea that an unknown function <span class="math">\(u(z)\)</span> can be approximated by a sum of <span class="math">\(N+1\)</span> basis functions <span class="math">\(\phi_n(z)\)</span>:
</p>
<div class="math">$$ u(z) \approx u_N(z) = \sum_{n=0}^N a_n \phi_n(z) $$</div>
<p>This approach has the advantage over finite differences that we can guarantee a smooth solution. (Of course, it has the disadvantage that we can't use a non-uniform grid to get more detail in only some areas: since the accuracy of our approximation depends on the number of basis functions we use, we can only add more detail to the entire domain.)</p>
<p>The function <span class="math">\(u(z)\)</span> is the solution to some differential equation <span class="math">\(Lu = f(z)\)</span>. Substituting the approximation into this equation defines a residual function:
</p>
<div class="math">$$ R(z; a_0, a_1, ..., a_N) = Lu_N - f $$</div>
<p>The residual function is zero for the exact solution. Spectral and pseudospectral methods try to choose the coefficients <span class="math">\(a_n\)</span> to minimize this residual. Collocation chooses these coefficients by requiring the residual function to be zero at selected points.</p>
<p>Chebyshev Collocation uses Chebyshev Polynomials as the basis functions (hence the name):
</p>
<div class="math">$$ \phi_n(z) = T_n(z) $$</div>
<p>
where <span class="math">\(z = \cos(\theta)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(T_n(z) \equiv \cos(n\theta)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Collocation (i.e. residual is set to zero) at the Gauss-Lobatto points:
</p>
<div class="math">$$ z_j = \cos\left(\frac{j\pi}{N}\right) $$</div>
<p>
These are the extrema of the <span class="math">\(N\)</span>-th Chebyshev polynomial. By requiring the residual function to be zero at these points, we can bound the truncation error of our solution.</p>
<h1>Boundary Conditions</h1>
<p>Unlike using a Fourier series to approximate a solution with periodic boundary conditions, Chebyshev polynomials do not automatically satisfy the appropriate boundary conditions. However, explicit constraints can be added:
</p>
<div class="math">$$ \sum_{n=0}^N a_n \phi_n(1) = \alpha $$</div>
<p>
Inserting this into the algebraic equations produced by our choice of minimization technique for <span class="math">\(R(x; a_0, a_1, ..., a_N)\)</span> causes <span class="math">\(u(1)=\alpha\)</span> to be satisfied by the approximate solution.</p>
<p>For collocation, we require the differential equation to be satisfied at each of the <span class="math">\(N+1\)</span> gridpoints. The equations for the boundary points can then by replaced with boundary constraints instead. We still have <span class="math">\(N+1\)</span> equations to find the <span class="math">\(N+1\)</span> unknown coefficients: the differential equation satisfied at the <span class="math">\(N-1\)</span> interior points, and two boundary constraints. </p>
<h1>The Problem</h1>
<p>If we are solving a second-order differential equation with two boundary conditions, we can easily apply Chebyshev collocation as described above. But, suppose instead, we consider the equivalent first-order system.</p>
<p>Analytically, the first-order system is equivalent to the second-order differential equation, but when we try to apply Chebyshev collocation, we run into a problem. The number of unknown coefficients and equations at the interior points have now doubled, but we still only have two boundary conditions: basically "half" a boundary condition at each boundary. So we now have <span class="math">\(2N+2\)</span> unknowns, and only <span class="math">\(2N\)</span> equations.</p>
<h1>Example: Wave Equation</h1>
<p>Let's look at an example, to demonstrate this issue. (Note that this is only a toy example: there is no reason that you would want to do this with the wave equation, but there are more complicated equations second-order equations that are substantially simpler in first-order system form.)</p>
<p>Consider the differential equation
</p>
<div class="math">$$ u'' = k^2u $$</div>
<p>
with boundary conditions <span class="math">\(u(-1) = 0 = u(1)\)</span>. This can be solved analytically for eigenvalues <span class="math">\(k\)</span>:
</p>
<div class="math">$$ k = \frac{n\pi}{2} $$</div>
<p>We can also write this as a first-order system:
</p>
<div class="math">$$ \begin{array}{l}
u' = kv \\
v' = ku
\end{array} $$</div>
<p>
Or, in vector form,
</p>
<div class="math">$$ w' = kAw $$</div>
<p>
where
</p>
<div class="math">$$ \begin{array}{lcr}w = \left[\begin{array}{c}u\\v\end{array}\right] &amp;\text{ and }&amp; A = \left[\begin{array}{ll}0&amp;1\\1&amp;0\end{array}\right]\end{array}$$</div>
<h2>Second-Order Equation</h2>
<p>Let's apply Chebyshev Collocation to our second-order equation. We approximate <span class="math">\(u\)</span> with a series of <span class="math">\(N+1\)</span> Chebyshev polynomials:
</p>
<div class="math">$$ u(x) \cong \sum_{n=0}^N a_n T_n(x) $$</div>
<p>Our differential equation must be satisfied at the Gauss-Lobatto points <span class="math">\(x_j = \cos\left(\frac{j\pi}{N}\right)\)</span>:
</p>
<div class="math">$$ \sum_{n=0}^N a_n T''_n(x_j) = k^2 \sum_{n=0}^N a_n T_n(x_j) $$</div>
<p>This can be written in matrix form, <span class="math">\(Ay = k^2 By\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(y\)</span> is the vector of coefficients <span class="math">\(a_n\)</span>. Each row in matrices <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> corresponds to one of the gridpoints <span class="math">\(x_j\)</span>.</p>
<p>To satisfy the boundary conditions, the rows corresponding to <span class="math">\(x_0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x_N\)</span> can be replaced by the boundary conditions <span class="math">\(u(\pm 1) = 0\)</span>; that is,
</p>
<div class="math">$$ \sum_{n=0}^N a_n T_n(\pm 1) = 0 $$</div>
<p>
In matrix form, this is
</p>
<div class="math">$$ \left[\begin{array}{ccc}0 &amp;...&amp; 0\end{array}\right] y = k^2 \left[\begin{array}{ccc} T_0(\pm 1) &amp;...&amp; T_N(\pm 1) \end{array} \right] y $$</div>
<p>
which can easily be substituted into the appropriate rows of <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span>.</p>
<p>The resulting matrix eigenvalue problem can be solved with a standard general eigenvalue algorithm. The numerical results match the analytical solution. </p>
<h2>First-Order System</h2>
<p>Like for the second-order equation, we approximate <span class="math">\(w\)</span> with a series of <span class="math">\(N+1\)</span> Chebyshev polynomials:
</p>
<div class="math">$$ w(x) \cong \sum_{n=0}^N \left[\begin{array}{c}a_n\\b_n\end{array}\right] T_n(x) $$</div>
<p>We now have a vector of coefficients for each element in the series, so we have <span class="math">\(2(N+1)\)</span> unknowns, rather than the <span class="math">\(N+1\)</span> unknowns we had in the previous case.</p>
<p>Again, our differential equation must be satisfied at the Gauss-Lobatto points, <span class="math">\(x_j = \cos\left(\frac{j\pi}{N}\right)\)</span>:
</p>
<div class="math">$$ \sum_{n=0}^N \mathbf{c_n} T'_n(x_j) = k A \sum_{n=0}^N \mathbf{c_n} T_n(x_j) $$</div>
<p>
where
</p>
<div class="math">$$\mathbf{c_n} = \left[\begin{array}{c}a_n\\b_n\end{array}\right]$$</div>
<p>Again, we can replace two rows by the boundary conditions <span class="math">\(u(\pm 1) = 0\)</span>:
</p>
<div class="math">$$ \sum_{n=0}^N a_n T_n(\pm 1) = 0 $$</div>
<p>
However, in this case, we have two matrix rows corresponding to each of <span class="math">\(x_0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x_N\)</span>, but we only have "half" a boundary condition on each boundary, since it is a boundary condition on <span class="math">\(u\)</span> rather than our vector variable <span class="math">\(w\)</span>.</p>
<p>If we require the differential equation to be satisfied at the interior Gauss-Lobatto points, and add the two "half" boundary conditions, this gives us <span class="math">\(2N\)</span> equations; however, we have <span class="math">\(2N + 2\)</span> unknowns (<span class="math">\(a_n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b_n\)</span>). </p>
<p>But clearly our system isn't actually underdetermined, since it's equivalent to the second-order case above. So, what can we try to add two more equations?</p>
<ol>
<li>Require the differential equation to be satisfied at one of the boundary points. </li>
<li>Overspecify the boundary conditions. As <span class="math">\(v'(x) = ku\)</span>, add the additional boundary condition <span class="math">\(v'(\pm 1) = 0\)</span>.</li>
<li>Consider the two equations separately, rather than as a system. Then, require the equation in <span class="math">\(u'(x)\)</span> to be satisfied at the interior collocation points, and the equation in <span class="math">\(v'(x)\)</span> to be satisfied at all collocation points. The boundary conditions on <span class="math">\(u\)</span> provide the remaining two equations.</li>
<li>Homogenize the boundary conditions. Rather than having both <span class="math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math">\(v\)</span> represented as a series of Chebyshev polynomials, define <span class="math">\(u\)</span> in terms of <span class="math">\(\phi_{2n}(x) = T_{2n}(x) - 1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\phi_{2n+1}(x) = T_{2n+1}(x) - x\)</span> for <span class="math">\(n = 1, 2, ...\)</span>. Using this basis function means that the boundary condition <span class="math">\(u(\pm 1) = 0\)</span> is automatically satisfied, and thus we can just consider the differential equation at all the Gauss-Lobatto points.</li>
</ol>
<p>All four methods give approximately the same values for the wavenumber <span class="math">\(k\)</span>. Unfortunately, the values are nowhere near the analytical solution, nor those from solving the second-order equation. </p>
<p>You might be wondering if this is due to some problem with the first-order system formulation in the first place. Apparently not, since solving the first-order system using a finite-difference method results in the correct solution. </p>
<p>This suggests that Chebyshev Collocation is just not a suitable technique for solving a first-order system of differential equations numerically. So if you find yourself with such a problem, you'll either need to work with the messier second-order equation, or use some other numerical method. </p>
