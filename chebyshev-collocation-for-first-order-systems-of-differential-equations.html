</footer><!-- /.post-info -->        <p>Suppose you have a differential equation that you want to solve numerically. An approach you might take is collocation, which is based on the idea that an unknown function $u(z)$ can be approximated by a sum of $N+1$ basis functions $\phi_n(z)$:
$$ u(z) \approx u_N(z) = \sum_{n=0}^N a_n \phi_n(z) $$</p>
<p>This approach has the advantage over finite differences that we can guarantee a smooth solution. (Of course, it has the disadvantage that we can't use a non-uniform grid to get more detail in only some areas: since the accuracy of our approximation depends on the number of basis functions we use, we can only add more detail to the entire domain.)</p>
<p>The function $u(z)$ is the solution to some differential equation $Lu = f(z)$. Substituting the approximation into this equation defines a residual function:
$$ R(z; a_0, a_1, ..., a_N) = Lu_N - f $$</p>
<p>The residual function is zero for the exact solution. Spectral and pseudospectral methods try to choose the coefficients $a_n$ to minimize this residual. Collocation chooses these coefficients by requiring the residual function to be zero at selected points.</p>
<p>Chebyshev Collocation uses Chebyshev Polynomials as the basis functions (hence the name):
$$ \phi_n(z) = T_n(z) $$
where $z = \cos(\theta)$ and $T_n(z) \equiv \cos(n\theta)$.</p>
<p>Collocation (i.e. residual is set to zero) at the Gauss-Lobatto points:
$$ z_j = \cos\left(\frac{j\pi}{N}\right) $$
These are the extrema of the $N$-th Chebyshev polynomial. By requiring the residual function to be zero at these points, we can bound the truncation error of our solution.</p>
<h1>Boundary Conditions</h1>
<p>Unlike using a Fourier series to approximate a solution with periodic boundary conditions, Chebyshev polynomials do not automatically satisfy the appropriate boundary conditions. However, explicit constraints can be added:
$$ \sum_{n=0}^N a_n \phi_n(1) = \alpha $$
Inserting this into the algebraic equations produced by our choice of minimization technique for $R(x; a_0, a_1, ..., a_N)$ causes $u(1)=\alpha$ to be satisfied by the approximate solution.</p>
<p>For collocation, we require the differential equation to be satisfied at each of the $N+1$ gridpoints. The equations for the boundary points can then by replaced with boundary constraints instead. We still have $N+1$ equations to find the $N+1$ unknown coefficients: the differential equation satisfied at the $N-1$ interior points, and two boundary constraints. </p>
<h1>The Problem</h1>
<p>If we are solving a second-order differential equation with two boundary conditions, we can easily apply Chebyshev collocation as described above. But, suppose instead, we consider the equivalent first-order system.</p>
<p>Analytically, the first-order system is equivalent to the second-order differential equation, but when we try to apply Chebyshev collocation, we run into a problem. The number of unknown coefficients and equations at the interior points have now doubled, but we still only have two boundary conditions: basically "half" a boundary condition at each boundary. So we now have $2N+2$ unknowns, and only $2N$ equations.</p>
<h1>Example: Wave Equation</h1>
<p>Let's look at an example, to demonstrate this issue. (Note that this is only a toy example: there is no reason that you would want to do this with the wave equation, but there are more complicated equations second-order equations that are substantially simpler in first-order system form.)</p>
<p>Consider the differential equation
$$ u'' = k^2u $$
with boundary conditions $u(-1) = 0 = u(1)$. This can be solved analytically for eigenvalues $k$:
$$ k = \frac{n\pi}{2} $$</p>
<p>We can also write this as a first-order system:
$$ \begin{array}{l}
u' = kv \
v' = ku
\end{array} $$
Or, in vector form,
$$ w' = kAw $$
where
$$ \begin{array}{lcr}w = \left[\begin{array}{c}u\v\end{array}\right] &amp;\text{ and }&amp; A = \left[\begin{array}{ll}0&amp;1\1&amp;0\end{array}\right]\end{array}$$</p>
<h2>Second-Order Equation</h2>
<p>Let's apply Chebyshev Collocation to our second-order equation. We approximate $u$ with a series of $N+1$ Chebyshev polynomials:
$$ u(x) \cong \sum_{n=0}^N a_n T_n(x) $$</p>
<p>Our differential equation must be satisfied at the Gauss-Lobatto points $x_j = \cos\left(\frac{j\pi}{N}\right)$:
$$ \sum_{n=0}^N a_n T''<em n="0">n(x_j) = k^2 \sum</em>^N a_n T_n(x_j) $$</p>
<p>This can be written in matrix form, $Ay = k^2 By$, where $y$ is the vector of coefficients $a_n$. Each row in matrices $A$ and $B$ corresponds to one of the gridpoints $x_j$.</p>
<p>To satisfy the boundary conditions, the rows corresponding to $x_0$ and $x_N$ can be replaced by the boundary conditions $u(\pm 1) = 0$; that is,
$$ \sum_{n=0}^N a_n T_n(\pm 1) = 0 $$
In matrix form, this is
$$ \left[\begin{array}{ccc}0 &amp;...&amp; 0\end{array}\right] y = k^2 \left[\begin{array}{ccc} T_0(\pm 1) &amp;...&amp; T_N(\pm 1) \end{array} \right] y $$
which can easily be substituted into the appropriate rows of $A$ and $B$.</p>
<p>The resulting matrix eigenvalue problem can be solved with a standard general eigenvalue algorithm. The numerical results match the analytical solution. </p>
<h2>First-Order System</h2>
<p>Like for the second-order equation, we approximate $w$ with a series of $N+1$ Chebyshev polynomials:
$$ w(x) \cong \sum_{n=0}^N \left[\begin{array}{c}a_n\b_n\end{array}\right] T_n(x) $$</p>
<p>We now have a vector of coefficients for each element in the series, so we have $2(N+1)$ unknowns, rather than the $N+1$ unknowns we had in the previous case.</p>
<p>Again, our differential equation must be satisfied at the Gauss-Lobatto points, $x_j = \cos\left(\frac{j\pi}{N}\right)$:
$$ \sum_{n=0}^N \mathbf{c_n} T'<em n="0">n(x_j) = k A \sum</em> T_n(x_j) $$
where
$$\mathbf{c_n} = \left[\begin{array}{c}a_n\b_n\end{array}\right]$$}^N \mathbf{c_n</p>
<p>Again, we can replace two rows by the boundary conditions $u(\pm 1) = 0$:
$$ \sum_{n=0}^N a_n T_n(\pm 1) = 0 $$
However, in this case, we have two matrix rows corresponding to each of $x_0$ and $x_N$, but we only have "half" a boundary condition on each boundary, since it is a boundary condition on $u$ rather than our vector variable $w$.</p>
<p>If we require the differential equation to be satisfied at the interior Gauss-Lobatto points, and add the two "half" boundary conditions, this gives us $2N$ equations; however, we have $2N + 2$ unknowns ($a_n$ and $b_n$). </p>
<p>But clearly our system isn't actually underdetermined, since it's equivalent to the second-order case above. So, what can we try to add two more equations?</p>
<ol>
<li>Require the differential equation to be satisfied at one of the boundary points. </li>
<li>Overspecify the boundary conditions. As $v'(x) = ku$, add the additional boundary condition $v'(\pm 1) = 0$.</li>
<li>Consider the two equations separately, rather than as a system. Then, require the equation in $u'(x)$ to be satisfied at the interior collocation points, and the equation in $v'(x)$ to be satisfied at all collocation points. The boundary conditions on $u$ provide the remaining two equations.</li>
<li>Homogenize the boundary conditions. Rather than having both $u$ and $v$ represented as a series of Chebyshev polynomials, define $u$ in terms of $\phi_{2n}(x) = T_{2n}(x) - 1$ and $\phi_{2n+1}(x) = T_{2n+1}(x) - x$ for $n = 1, 2, ...$. Using this basis function means that the boundary condition $u(\pm 1) = 0$ is automatically satisfied, and thus we can just consider the differential equation at all the Gauss-Lobatto points.</li>
</ol>
<p>All four methods give approximately the same values for the wavenumber $k$. Unfortunately, the values are nowhere near the analytical solution, nor those from solving the second-order equation. </p>
<p>You might be wondering if this is due to some problem with the first-order system formulation in the first place. Apparently not, since solving the first-order system using a finite-difference method results in the correct solution. </p>
<p>This suggests that Chebyshev Collocation is just not a suitable technique for solving a first-order system of differential equations numerically. So if you find yourself with such a problem, you'll either need to work with the messier second-order equation, or use some other numerical method. </p>
